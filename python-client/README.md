python-client
==============

###Getting started

This python client provides a simple app engine application which fetches data from the
<a href="https://developers.google.com/genomics">Google Genomics API</a> through a web interface.

To run this code, you'll need to
<a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/gettingstartedpython27/introduction">set up an app engine environment</a>.

You will also need to follow the <a href="https://developers.google.com/genomics/v1beta/quickstart">quickstart instructions</a>
to generate a valid client_secrets.json file. However, for this application you want to generate secrets
for a "Web application" rather than a "Native Application".

Replace the client_secrets.json file in this directory with your new secrets file.

Then, run this app engine app locally and visit http://localhost:8080 to browse data from the API.
